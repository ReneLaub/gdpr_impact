These data are often used to improve the performance of online advertising, which publishershere defined as websites or apps that provide space to display adsrely on to finance the free content to which their users have become accustomed. Until recently, such data collection was massive in scope, and often occurred without users permission, which led to a loss of user privacy. In response, policymakers in Europe and elsewhere have put forward initiatives to protect user privacy. One of the most prominent regulations is Europes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018; this regulation is at the focus of the current book. The GDPR will be complemented by the ePrivacy Regulation (ePR). Outside Europe, large-scale initiatives to protect user privacy include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Indias Personal Data Protection Law (PDPB), Thailands Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), Brazils Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) and Chinas Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL). These laws prevent firms from processing personal data, where the term processing encompasses a wide range of operations, including collecting, combining and storing personal data. The main purpose of these laws is to protect users privacy. In fact, comprehensive reviews of privacy literature emphasize that there is no widely agreed-upon definition of privacy (Bleier, Goldfarb, and Tucker (2020), Martin and Murphy (2017), Norberg, Horne, and Horne (2007) and Wieringa et al. 2021). Westin (1967) defined privacy as the ability of the individual to control the terms under which personal information is acquired and used. The GDPR effectively relies on this conceptualization of privacy, as its main provisions focus on users control over their personal data. Herein, we adopt a similar perspective of the construct of privacywith some extensions. For example, in line with a common approach in the popular media, we assume that a more extensive collection of data from consumers implies less privacy. In restricting the processing of personal data, privacy laws affect online advertising and, thus, the different actors operating in the online advertising market. Though several studies have begun to explore these effects (e.g., Peukert et al. 2022; Schmitt, Miller, and Skiera 2021), researchers and policymakers have yet to obtain a comprehensive and precise understanding of the implications of privacy laws for the online advertising market. This lack of clarity is unfortunate because as regulations continue to be formulated or updated, it is crucial for regulators and societies at large to understand the trade-off between user privacy and the economic value that the online advertising industry derives from processing personal data through potentially privacy-infringing technologies. Likewise, firms in the online advertising industry need to understand the implications of stricter privacy requirements for their performance, so as to adjust to these requirements effectively. Finally, users also deserve to understand what happens with their data, and the consequences of such data usage, or restrictions thereof. One important reason for the lack of clarity on the implications of privacy laws for advertising is that the online advertising market is difficult to understand. It is a high-tech industry that comprises several extensive networks with many actors, as we will illustrate in these pages (see, in particular, our illustration of the complexity of the industry in Section 2 and our empirical study in Section 8). From a technological perspective, these actors accomplish extraordinary feats, such as conducting billions of auctions with many participants each day to sell single ad impressions in less than 100 milliseconds, or displaying personalized ads to millions of users. Because of the complex technologies used in online advertising, effective decision-making in this market requires combining a technological perspective (e.g., finding the best technology to track users) with a marketing perspective (e.g., finding the best users to target). With the launch of far-reaching privacy laws such as the GDPR, it is becoming increasingly important for actors in this industry to consider the legal perspective as well. The need to combine these three perspectives implies that professionals in the advertising field must possess some level of expertise in multiple domains. For example, lawyers in the advertising industry need to understand what cookies and consent strings are, and marketing managers and IT experts need to understand the meanings of legal terms such as legitimate interest or identifiable individual. Our vision for this book is, thus, to provide an accessible yet comprehensive synthesis of what is currently known about how privacy lawsparticularly the GDPRaffect the online advertising market. To this end, we highlight the requirements stipulated in the GDPR that are most relevant to the advertising industry, and we further clarify the implications of these requirements for the key actors in this industry, as well as for users. In doing so, we aim to provide actors in this market (in particular advertisers, publishers and users), as well as regulators and society at large, with better tools to (i) assess the trade-off between the benefits and the costs of more privacy, (ii) understand problems in implementing the requirements of GDPR, and (iii) draw conclusions on how to deal with the stricter privacy requirements that come with privacy laws such as the GDPR. The remainder of this book is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines how the online advertising industry operates. Section 3 provides a basic overview of tracking technologies, the ways in which publishers, advertisers, and other firms use them, and the implications of tracking for users. Section 4 elaborates on the contents of the GDPR, focusing on the obligations relevant to firms in the advertising industry. In Section 5, we discuss the GDPR requirement that affects the advertising industry most profoundly: the need to secure a legal basis for data processing, which, in practice, entails obtaining user permission for data processing for specific purposese.g., via consent management tools, discussed in Section 6. Section 7 provides a step-by-step description of the procedure that firms must undertake to obtain user permission for data processing, and it presents a framework developed by IAB Europe, Europes industry association for digital marketing and advertising, to assist firms in accomplishing this process (the Transparency and Consent Framework; TCF). Section 8 provides an empirical assessment of the complexity that firms face in obtaining permission, as well as the complexity that users face in handling permission requests. Section 9 provides an outlook on future developments in the advertising industry and in the regulatory landscape with regard to the processing of users personal data. Finally, Section 10 provides conclusions.

Thus, there are three essential actors in online advertising (in alphabetical order): the advertiser, who wishes to draw the users interest to the advertisers offerings; the publisher, who has some space to show ads and would like to monetize the user by selling those ad spaces to the advertiser; the user, who is primarily interested in the publishers offering (e.g., the content of a news website) and is sometimes also interested in the ads displayed on the site. Figure 1 outlines the business models of advertisers and publishers; the exchanges that occur among advertisers, publishers and users; and the (often implicit) agreements among them. Figure 1: Interplay among the Essential Actors of the Online Advertising Market Many publishers offer users free access to their contente.g., newsin exchange for the ability to collect data from these users, as well as to provide other actors, such as advertisers, with opportunities to contact the users. Thus, even when users ostensibly receive content without paying for it, they are still payingnot with money but with their data and willingness to view ads. Advertisers pay publishers for the opportunity to contact users and, to a lesser extent, pay for data about those users. Advertisers then proceed to display ads to users and, in cases in which relevant data are available, they may target certain users and even personalize ads to their preferences. Users, in turn, are expected to see those ads and, at least in some cases, to purchase the advertisers offeringswhere a purchase is broadly defined as a desired action that benefits the advertiser (including, for example, buying products, subscribing to an online newsletter, signing up for a test drive of a car, downloading a document, or donating). At the heart of this interplay between the various actors is the tracking of users, which provides advertisers with two key capabilities. The first is the capacity to process data about users for profiling, which enables advertisers to better target ads to appropriate users, and thus to avoid wastage of ads. For example, an advertiser likely prefers to avoid sending a male user an ad for female hygiene products (and the other way around). The second is the capacity to recognize, at least to some extent, whether the ads are successfulwhich, in turn, enables the advertiser to determine whether it is worthwhile to continue spending money on a given publisher (and, ultimately, on the publishers users). For example, if an ad served on a particular publisher does not receive any user reaction (as measured, e.g., by clicks on the ad), the advertiser might then conclude that, for the specific advertisement, the publisher does not attract the right audience, i.e., the right type of user. Alongside these benefits, however, user tracking raises privacy concerns, as elaborated in subsequent sections. 2.2 Scope and Types of Online Advertising The online advertising industry is large and represents an essential part of the economy. Internet advertising revenues have grown consistently over recent years; in 2020, for example, the growth rate in the US was an impressive 12.2%, with revenues reaching $139.8b (IAB 2021). Advertisers spent 70% of all online advertising funds on advertising on mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets) and 30% on desktop platforms. Regarding ad format, the largest share of funds (42.2%, see Figure 2) is spent on search engine ads, i.e., ads delivered via search engines, notably Google. Display advertising (i.e., banner advertising) represents the second-largest share (31.5%), and video advertising, e.g., on YouTube, the third-largest share (18.7%). Other forms of online advertising (e.g., classified advertising, audio formats, lead generation ads) play a minor role. The ad-selling market is highly concentrated; indeed, in 2020, the top 10 publishers realized 78.1% of all advertising revenues (IAB 2021). Google and Facebook are by far the two largest publishers in the Western world. The ad-buying marketing is far less concentrated, i.e., there are no advertisers that dominate the demand side in a manner comparable to Google and Facebook on the supply side. Figure 2: Size and Share of Figure 2: Different Formats of Online Advertising in the US (IAB 2021) Figure 3 outlines the digital advertising spend per capita for selected European countries (IAB 2020). Advertising expenditures per internet user are, by far, highest in the UK (324.70), followed by Norway (231.30), Sweden (229.40), Switzerland (212.40) and Denmark (194.80). In Germany, the average amount spent per Internet user is 113.40. Figure 3: Digital Advertising Spend per Capita in 15 countries (IAB 2020) Figure 3: Digital Advertising Spend per Capita in 15 countries (IAB 2020) 2.3 Real-Time Bidding as a Process of Selling Online Advertising In this subsection, we describe a prominent process of selling online advertising, which we refer to as real-time bidding (RTB), and which is also referred to in the industry as programmatic advertising, because advertisers and publishers use algorithms to buy and sell advertising (Kosorin 2016). The 2021 IAB report (IAB 2021) outlines that 88% of ads (excluding search) sell as programmatic advertising. This process constitutes a key source of concern for regulators and privacy advocates. For clarity of presentation, in what follows, our discussion focuses primarily on online display advertising (also referred to as banner advertising) but selling digital video ads shares many characteristics. Online display advertising is well known to most users and raises many privacy concerns because it often involves exchanging data between firms. It uses an auction-based system to sell ads, as search ads also do. Other forms of advertising, including traditional offline advertising such as TV and outdoor, gradually implement comparable systems. Real-time bidding is a collective term for the technological infrastructure used to sell opportunities to display an ad in real-time and in a fully automated manner (Yuan, Wang, and Zhao 2013, Wang, Zhang, and Yuan 2017). In many cases, selling occurs via real-time auctions that run for less than 100 milliseconds (for reference, a blink of an eye takes 200-400 milliseconds). Ad exchanges (e.g., Xandr), marketplaces that connect advertisers and publishers, frequently serve as platforms for such real-time auctions (Cristal 2014, Kosorin 2016, Lee, Jalali, and Dasdan 2013, Information Commissioners Office 2019; Ada, Abou Nabout, and McDonnell Feit 2022). Figure 4 illustrates the automated auction process under real-time bidding. For convenience, we refer to a scenario in which an ad slot is being sold on a website, but the general process we describe is applicable to other online media that belong to a publisher and contain ad slots, such as apps. As shown in the figure, whenever a user visits a publishers website with ad slots (1), the publisher sends an ad call to an ad exchange (2). This ad call is a request to run a real-time auction on the ad exchange and contains information about, for example, the properties of the ad slot (e.g., ad size) and a user ID, which we explain in more detail in Section 3.1. The ad exchange then sends a bid request to all advertisers on the ad exchange (3). Each interested advertiser submits a bid for displaying its ad to the user; the bid also includes the ad servers address with the ad (4). The ad exchange determines the price and the winner of the auction and forwards this information to the publisher (5). The publisher then asks the users browser to load the ad from the ad server (6), and the ad is subsequently displayed to the user on the publishers website (7). Figure 4: Illustration of the Auction Process in Real-Time Bidding (RTB) This description of the real-time auction process is a simplification, because it only captures essential steps (for more details, see Cristal 2014, Kosorin 2016, Trusov, Ma, and Jamal 2016 or Wang, Zhang, and Yuan 2017). It does not consider, for example, the specific requirements imposed by privacy laws such as the GDPR (which we will outline later in Section 6 when discussing the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)). In addition, it is important to acknowledge that there are many other actors that support the activities of advertisers and publishers (Luma Partners 2021). We describe these other actors in the following subsection. 2.4 Description of Other Actors Figure 5 classifies the numerous actors in the online advertising industry into several main groups that we will not all cover here. Figure 5: Overview of Actors in the Online Advertising Industry (DisplayLUMAscape) Note that Luma Partners (2021) refer in this figure to an advertiser as a marketer and to users as people. An ad exchange, as noted above, is a marketplace where the demand side, i.e., advertisers, and the supply side, i.e., publishers, meet to fill ad slots (offered by publishers) with ads (provided by advertisers). A demand-side platform (DSP) is a technology provider that supports the advertiser buying ad slots. A supply-side platform (SSP) provides technology to support the publisher selling its ad slots. An advertising agency helps the advertiser with the creation of the ad. An ad server is a web server (i.e., a computer) that stores advertising content (e.g., banner ads). It delivers that content to the publishers ad slot and, thus, the user (in our setting, the users browser). Many additional actors exist that support the process of selling ad slots and delivering ads to those ad slots. Among them are data management platforms (DMPs), which provide data about the user (e.g., demographics or user interests), or verification providers that verify that an ad appears on the correct publisher. The advertiser and the publisher have to finance all actors. As a result, the price that the advertiser pays for an ad is often much higher than the amount that the publisher receives. Google, for example, outlines that its publishers received over 69% of the money that the advertiser paid (Hsiao 2020). The share of the money that the publisher receives goes further down if the seller and buying of ads involve more actors. For example, the Guardian reports that this share can drop to 30% (Pidgeon 2016). Figure 6 provides a schematic illustration of how the various actors operate together to produce what the user ultimately views (in terms of both content and ads). In effect, when the user visits a publishers website (e.g., a news website), two processes are initiated. The first process (marked in orange) delivers the websites primary content (in our example, news content). This content is available on the publishers content server. The second process (marked in blue) is the process through which ads slots are sold and ads are delivered to the user. Our discussion focuses on the latter process; accordingly, in Figure 6, the process marked in orange is simplified and does not include other actors that may be involved in content delivery, such as measurement and analytics providers that track, for example, how often a user saw certain content and that help the publisher optimize its content. Figure 6: Delivery of Content and Ads from the Users Perspective when Visiting a Website The process of selling ad slots and delivering ads involves the following steps. The publishers ad server recognizes an available ad slot (usually even multiple ad slots) that the publisher would like to fill with an ad. The ad server approaches the supply-side platform (SSP) with a request to sell the ad slot on the ad exchange. The SSP sets up the auction on the ad exchange, and the ad exchange approaches the advertisers, usually via several demand-side platforms (DSPs), with a request for a quote for the ad slot, i.e., offering the opportunity to buy the opportunity to display an ad to the specific user. It is essential to understand that any data that the publisher reveals can spread to many other actors. That is a concern that Ryan (2018) raises. He outlines that it is technically feasible to share a wide range of information along the chain outlined in Figure 6. Such sharing raises privacy concerns. It is, however, less clear whether and how intensively sharing of personal data occurs. 2.5 Main Takeaways The main takeaways from Section 2 are: The three main actors in the online advertising industry are advertisers, publishers, and users. Between each pair of actors, a transaction takes placewhether implicitly or explicitly agreed upon. 70% of online advertising occurs on mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets). The main advertising formats are search engine advertising, online display advertising and video advertising. Real-time bidding is the primary process through which the selling of display advertising occurs. Data sharing in real-time bidding is a source of privacy concerns. Many publishers rely on advertising to finance their content. They often do not charge users, but users then pay by providing publishers and advertisers (often implicitly) with data, as well as willingness to view ads. Selling and displaying online (display) advertising involves many different actors and requires sophisticated technologies. Indeed, the online advertising industry is effectively a high-tech industry.
